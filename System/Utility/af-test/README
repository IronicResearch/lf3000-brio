t1 is a stand alone, can be run on ubuntu or emerald (as game user,
not root).  It will return "# successful tests" or a failure message
as last line of output. (14 as of Feb 10, 2010).

t2 is a test designed to be run on emeraldunder a modified /etc/init.d/rcS:
  x=/LF/Bulk/safe-file
  echo "$x:" `cat $x`
  x=/LF/Bulk/risky-file
  echo "$x:" `cat $x`
  /LF/t2 &
  sleep 1;
  reboot -f

You will see risky-file's count reset to 0, while safe-file should
keep on counting
