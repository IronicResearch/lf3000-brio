Atomic I/O unit tests

Adjust compiler in Makefile for emerald device or ubuntu target

t1 is a stand alone, can be run on ubuntu or emerald.  It will return
"# successful tests" or a failure message last.

t2 is a test designed to be run on emerald under a modified /etc/init.d/rcS:
  x=/LF/Bulk/safe-file
  echo "$x:" `cat $x`
  x=/LF/Bulk/risky-file
  echo "$x:" `cat $x`
  /LF/t2 &
  sleep 1;
  reboot -f

You will see risky-file's count reset to 0, while safe-file should
keep on counting
