A number of features in the audio code are not implemented in the fashion in
which they were designed.  Level meters and file dumps are two examples.  These
features should be implemented as audio effects, not as runtime or compile time
options.  This will allow the audio code to stabilize while permitting
extensibility.  This directory contains features that are to be integrated in
the future.  Feel free to add files here and document their inteded integration.

LevelMeter.cpp: This is not working code.  It is a place holder for the level
meter code that was originally in the mixer.  It should be implemented as a
audio effect once that feature is in place.  That is, it should extend the
IAudioEffect base class and be added to the processing chain using the suitable
AudioMPI call, once that feature is supported.

OutputEqualizer.cpp: Same story as LevelMeter.cpp.

FileDumper.cpp: Same story as LevelMeter.cpp.  It's meant to take an output dump
of a channel.
