Revision 416 from svn://localhost/TRUNK/:

I'm adding the "ustring" third party package.  It is based on glibmm and its
numerous dependencies.  The output libraries are greater than 2MB!  This
library should really be optimized.  libiconv is the biggest hog at 1.2MB.
This is probably because it is set up to support tons of languages?  Otherwise,
there's tons of glib stuff that can surely be cut out.  See the README for
details about what's going on.

Revision 997 from svn://localhost/TRUNK/:

Fix for assembly code acceleration for Mobileer MIDI engine.  The "P1" fix is most of the improvement, providing a metric (have to use that word as everyone, including those without an on-line MBA, else is currently using it twenty times a day).

With the "P1" fix, the MIDi engine needs 1.70 MIPS/voice when 16 voices are playing at fs=16000Hz.  The "P2" fix promises more improvement to 1.59 MIPS/voice, though currently, there is some sort of stereo bug.

NO ARM :     2.4 MIPS/voice    (38 MIPS/16 voices)
P1 ARM:       1.7 MIPS/voice   (27 MIPS/16 voices)
P2 ARM:       1.6 MIPS/voice   (25 MIPS/16 voices)

Only the "P1" fix is currently enabled in the ARM build.

Revision 1,013 from svn://localhost/TRUNK/:

Re-work the message queue code in the audio system.  Now it will delete pre-existing msg queues
and re-create them in case the parameters of the queue have changed.  This keeps developers
from having to delete queues by hand in the file system.  I also cleaned up error checking.  This 
change required a tweak to the Kernel module because the only way to find out if a queue exists 
is to try to Open it with create|exclusive bits set.  You get back the posix error EEXIST, which the 
kernel module was treating as a fatal error.

Revision 1,045 from svn://localhost/TRUNK/:

Fix several nasty-subtle crashing bugs in the audio system.  The RenderBuffer() calls needed to be protected with a mutex so that 
the method won't get called in the middle of its destructor.  There was also a problem with a message being sent by the 
AudioTask that wasn't being polled for by the AudioModule so the state of the world could get way out of sync.  
The Channel::Release() method also had a problem where it was deleting its player object before setting itself to an
invalid state so the Mixer would stop calling its RenderBuffer() method.  This fixes TTPro #22.

However the build system still seems to be choosing the wrong library, perhaps
it's hard-coded somewhere?

Revision 1,469 from svn://localhost/TRUNK/:

Change the way AudioDone events are generated.  There was a logic problem causing a lockup when StartAudio() was called'
in an AudioDone event Listener's Notify() method.  This is a first-pass fix for the content team (TTPro #46).  A full fix involves
sending the AudioDone event from the Mixer after the player is deleted and the channel is free.  With this fix there is no lockup,
but to do an audio sequence with the AudioDone event requires two free audio channels; more of a ping-pong than a sequence.

Okay.  I made the USB Device manager spawn a process and run a script.  I know
this is a bit sinful, but we have all sorts of mounting and unmounting,
grepping, and other script-like stuff.  So that's how it is.  If you want to go
about creating a userspace lib implementing the usb behavior that we're trying
to acheive, that's probably more sensible...and time consuming.

Another suggested method if this solution will not be successful is to make the debug level a member variable of the the CDebugMPI object instead of the CDebugModule singleton

Fix for audio "deadlock" issue, though it was more of a crash due to 
multi-threading.  This fix required some thread reorganization, so it 
was more of an audio artchitecture change than a simple fix.  Audio 
render threads no longer create and delete objects.  Whew.

Testde with PlayAudio and BrioMixer for Wav/Ogg/Raw/MIDI playback, 
SendDone message, and looping.  Everthing works, although for this 
check-in , stereo WAV/Raw doesn't work.  Mono WAV/RAW works, though.

----------------
Revision 2,426 from svn://localhost/TRUNK/:
Revision 2,427 from svn://localhost/TRUNK/:


1. System/Include/AudioTypes.h
    Changed type of audio and MIDI IDs as code would always flag the noAudioID=0xffffffff as too big for type

2. System/Include/AudioMPI.h
      Updated API comments and added MIDI controller definitions

3. System/Audio/PublicMPI/AudioMPI.cpp
      Added secret functions (not exposed in header file) to read parts of audio driver for   
     parameter debugging, messaging, audio metering, enabling soft clipper, output EQ, changing
    sampling rate conversion algorithm, setting read/write file, etc.

4. AudioMsg.h
    Added message for Get/Set AudioState()

5. Channel.cpp, Channel.h 
    Removed clipping loop from here.

6. Mixer.cpp
    Added interfacing functions to Get/Set AudioState.  Added level metering (short time,
    long time with peak/hold, and run-time max values).   Removed floating point ops from
    meter decay function.

Dsputil.cpp :   removed extranrous gain from SRC algorithm that was causing clipping in
    16000 Hz samples only.

Removed Mutex functions from audio loop to fix dead lock issue.  
Improved MIDI mutex reliability.

Revision 2,568 from svn://localhost/TRUNK/:

****** FIXED for 01/07/2008 Checkin ******
  05. MIDI:  Added definitions for Channel Status message and Mobileer-supported controllers

  06. Audio:  Plugging headphone jack while playing locks up app on Embedded
           --> Don't see this anymore.  Code for doing this switch had been removed  - strange.

  31. Audio:  Make pre gain of Soft Clipper programmable 

  12. MIDI:  too quiet -> Double volume and check for clipping
             a. Set to twice SPMIDI_DEFAULT_MASTER_VOLUME
            	void SPMIDI_SetMasterVolume( SPMIDI_Context *spmidiContext, int masterVolume );

  12. MIDI:   CRASH when loading files with local path.  Some sort of ustring issue that
             crept in during other releases.  This was the same problem that plagued AppManager for audio.  WEIRD.

  34: Audio:  Add Mixer:Update()and Set() to recalculate low-level parameters in response to external SetAudio()

  01. Reduced memory foot print of audio mixer (minimized internal buffer count)

  30. Audio:  check playback of 8000 Hz audio -> now works
(40-42 are probably related)

  40. Audio:  Startup pop on occasion for 16k samples (but not for 32k)
                a. Raw/WAV -> FIXED
                b. Vorbis  -> pops

  41. MIDI :  Initial play often starts with a pop, at least for MIDI.  Clear 08k and 16k audio path ?

  42. Audio:  Mixer.cpp : Check SRC temp ptr for use of buffers.  Otherwise, delete.  May be in MixBuf
                        // FIXXXX: mystery.  Offset Ptrs don't work !!!

  34. Audio MEM: Mixer temp bufs buffer 2x too big. Still need it?  
            --> Not after fixing the 08/16k click issue.

  17. Audio:  Mixer::Render():  eliminate divisions for fs/4 and fs/2 operations

  18. Audio CPU: STARTUP: disabled calculation of large floating point wave table used for past tests

  33. MIDI:  TTPro880 transpose tracks MPI call isn't supported by Mobileer engine
           PROBLEM WITH FROZEN MPI
            Easy solution:  update MPI interface
            Harder solution:  ask Mobileer to implement according to LF MPI
        --> Fixed using MIDI RPN control

  05. AudioMPI:  Bug in IsAudioPlaying()
  33. Audio Hardware?:  Panning reveals that speaker is receiving only one channel
            --> Fixed by Scott Esters
  34. Audio:  too quiet:  tweak gain to Soft Clipper  
        +4dB a good start
0.25 ->-12.04 dB

don't hard-code keyboard as /dev/input/event0 in Brio so that we can have 
multiple eventX nodes.  Instead, do a scan (once) for the keyboard that
matches the model name "LF1000 Keyboard" and use that device node.  Added
GetKeyboardName() to Utility, this should be used to retrieve the file path
for use with open() instead of assuming one.

Revision 2,901 from svn://localhost/TRUNK/:

fixing memory leaks in Brio's "kernel timer" implementation.  There were two problems:
- a malloc for 'timer data' for the sigevent handler, the reference to which is never saved 
  anywhere and therefore never freed
- failure to free an iterator after using it
The solution to the unsaved reference here is to save a reference into ListData.  This is not very
nice, the reference should probably be saved along with the handle.  Unfortunately at this point
it's not safe to change the way the handle is defined, so I opted for the (internal) list object
for now.

Revision 2,935 from svn://localhost/TRUNK/:

Fixing bugs in "Brio kernel timer" implementation and tests.  The following 
issues are dealt with:
- removed use of RTC driver in place of gettimeofday() on embedded.  Embedded
  and emulation do the same thing now.  gettimeofday() is a POSIX function, it
  works fine.  The attempt at using the RTC was not needed, and had mistakes in
  its implementation that lead to unreliable high-res. timers.  Removed the 
  additional mutexes for these 'timers' as well.
- renamed mutexes.  Names like "mutex_1" are not really helpful.  Fixed the
  locking/unlocking to use the same mutex.  For whatever reason, the code was
  using different mutexes for adding to and removing from a list... this makes
  no sense.
- got rid of various cruft and fixed API misuse: localtime() is a Linux 
  function, not POSIX.  Using a "POSIX assert" and assuming that errno gets set
  won't work.  
- reimplemented several unit tests.  When you sleep() on a multi-tasking 
  system, do not assume that you will wake up exactly after time X.  By 
  sleeping, you've given up the CPU and there are other things running!

Revision 2,968 from svn://localhost/TRUNK/:

The initial cartridge event was reported incorrectly, in addition two edge 
cases (inserting or removing a cart. while Linux is booting) could cause 
problems.  To resolve this we:
1) read the "initial state" of the cartridge (as reported by the bootloader and
   made available via sysfs)
2) during init, compare that initial state to the present state of the 
   cartridge.  If the state differs, we must report a transition.  Otherwise
   we just mark the state and wait for it to actually change later.

Revision 3,066 from svn://localhost/TRUNK/:

Make MidiPlayer extend AudioPlayer so that it can be treated the same as all
other players.  This paves the way for the normalized audio interface.  It will
also make implementation of priority, audio effects, and other features
dramatically simpler.

Revision 3,070 from svn://localhost/TRUNK/:

callbacks entirely from Mixer.cpp.  Simpler.

Revision 3,071 from svn://localhost/TRUNK/:
Revision 3,072 from svn://localhost/TRUNK/:

Start pushing all mixer functionality from Audio.cpp front end into mixer.  The
first step was to add a symmetric "RemovePlayer" to match "StartPlayer."  This
required introducing a version of FindChannel for internal use only that
doesn't try to take the mixer lock.

Eliminate redundant internal functionon GetPlayerPtr

Done messages are always sent from Mixer, never from players or channels.  Code
clean-up to follow.

Players are created AND deleted from the Mixer, not created by the mixer and
deleted by the channel!!

Had to crank event priority back up to 0 from 128 to prevent freed stack
variables from being dereferenced in event manager's deferred handler.

Revision 3,073 from svn://localhost/TRUNK/:

don't need the temp buffer.  This would be an optimization for a later time.

We're just going to have to leave this functionality broken.

Revision 3,202 from svn://localhost/TRUNK/:

Revert Audio MPI optimization where player objects were deleted after playback is done. Player objects are now deleted prior to new ones being created at next channel assignment step (pre-SVN 3087). Note that since player objects are now being retained longer, additional logic conditionals for player IsDone() are necessary (similar to old IsInUse flag). This reversion is necessary for Nicktoons game title to work with post-GM Brio (TTP# 1860).

integer.

Revision 4,694 from svn://localhost/TRUNK/:

Interim merge of Vorbis 1.2.0 code into local Tremor tree. (Development will not impact Brio builds until final binaries are checked in once they are working.) 

Most noteworthy finding is that Tremor code was using old Ogg packet structures and functions internally instead of referencing Ogg headers and libs externally. The merge will be successfully completed when able to parse any mixed-mode Ogg packets like Theora instead of handing only Vorbis packets. The fixed-point decoding and quantization routines are isolated in separate code modules and should not need to be updated.

Revision 5,748 from svn://localhost/TRUNK/:
Revision 5,749 from svn://localhost/TRUNK/:

Unlock mixer around slow CreatePlayer call.  This has the benefit of
allowing the mixer to render while the slow call is running, rather
than being held off.  Overall, this reduces underrun cases and gives
us the freedom to shrink the number of audio buffers in the driver,
ultimately reducing audio latency.

Revision 6,020 from svn://localhost/TRUNK/:

This patch addressed TTPro 1693: Brio looks through /dev/input looking for
eventN files and we had an arbitrary upper limit of 8 files.  Change Brio to
just "ls" the directory and look at every eventN file rather than having the
arbitrary limit.  This should not affect existing code/configs, however it
enables the AppManager to find its devices (touchscreen, for example) in cases
where those devices are found after additional HID devices like a USB
keyboard.

On the Linux side, we need more /dev/input/eventN files (device nodes)!  This
will be addressed separately.  The correct fix is to use hotplug+mdev however
at this time we'll likely just increase the number of statically-created nodes
to cover having more devices.  Brio2 however will now be robust enough to
handle additional nodes, either way.
