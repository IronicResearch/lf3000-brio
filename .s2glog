Revision 416 from svn://localhost/TRUNK/:

I'm adding the "ustring" third party package.  It is based on glibmm and its
numerous dependencies.  The output libraries are greater than 2MB!  This
library should really be optimized.  libiconv is the biggest hog at 1.2MB.
This is probably because it is set up to support tons of languages?  Otherwise,
there's tons of glib stuff that can surely be cut out.  See the README for
details about what's going on.

Revision 997 from svn://localhost/TRUNK/:

Fix for assembly code acceleration for Mobileer MIDI engine.  The "P1" fix is most of the improvement, providing a metric (have to use that word as everyone, including those without an on-line MBA, else is currently using it twenty times a day).

With the "P1" fix, the MIDi engine needs 1.70 MIPS/voice when 16 voices are playing at fs=16000Hz.  The "P2" fix promises more improvement to 1.59 MIPS/voice, though currently, there is some sort of stereo bug.

NO ARM :     2.4 MIPS/voice    (38 MIPS/16 voices)
P1 ARM:       1.7 MIPS/voice   (27 MIPS/16 voices)
P2 ARM:       1.6 MIPS/voice   (25 MIPS/16 voices)

Only the "P1" fix is currently enabled in the ARM build.

Revision 1,013 from svn://localhost/TRUNK/:

Re-work the message queue code in the audio system.  Now it will delete pre-existing msg queues
and re-create them in case the parameters of the queue have changed.  This keeps developers
from having to delete queues by hand in the file system.  I also cleaned up error checking.  This 
change required a tweak to the Kernel module because the only way to find out if a queue exists 
is to try to Open it with create|exclusive bits set.  You get back the posix error EEXIST, which the 
kernel module was treating as a fatal error.

Revision 1,045 from svn://localhost/TRUNK/:

Fix several nasty-subtle crashing bugs in the audio system.  The RenderBuffer() calls needed to be protected with a mutex so that 
the method won't get called in the middle of its destructor.  There was also a problem with a message being sent by the 
AudioTask that wasn't being polled for by the AudioModule so the state of the world could get way out of sync.  
The Channel::Release() method also had a problem where it was deleting its player object before setting itself to an
invalid state so the Mixer would stop calling its RenderBuffer() method.  This fixes TTPro #22.
