Lightning C++ Development Kit Release Notes
===========================================

===========================================
v0.1.4  (Build 336, released May 18, 2007) 
===========================================

Release for emulation target with Audio module implementation.

===========================================
v0.1.3  (Build 321, released May 17, 2007) 
===========================================

Release only for target hardware, not emulation.

First release that runs on target hardware (MP2530F).  Note that this release
is meant to work with the following software components on the target
hardware:

* Linux Kernel Image: zImage-2.6.20.1-dev-00
* u-boot image: u-boot-svn183.bin
* root file system: nfsroot-svn321.tar.gz

The cross-compiler for building the embedded target binaries is:

* scratchbox-toolchain-arm-gcc4.1-uclibc20061004

Enhancements:
-------------
* 2D layer support via Display Manager.
* 3D layer and 3D accelerator support via BrioOpenGLConfig. 

Known Issues:
-------------
* Some Kernel Manager services need fixing, as seen in testKernel.
* Resource Manager services will not work until /LF/System directory tree
  is installed on root file system.
* Event handling in BrioCube demo is disabled in embedded target build
  due to Kernel and Resource manager problems.
* When specifying deploy_dir to scons in the examples, specify the absolute
  path to where you expect the executable to be installed.  For example:
  deploy_dir=/home/lfu/nfsroot/usr/local/bin.  However, if INSTALL_PREFIX is
  set in the environment, INSTALL_PREFIX/usr/local/bin will be the install
  destination.  Expect this to become cleaner in future releases.
* Whey you run the scons install target in the examples, only the program is
  installed; the resources (such as Verdana.ttf) are not installed.  They must
  be copied over manually.
* Currently, on the embedded target, the module manager and other components
  are not properly cleaned up if they crash.  This may be a problem with Brio,
  or it may be a problem with Linux.  So, if you use ctl-c to kill a Brio app,
  or if your Brio app crashes, you will probably have to reset the board.

===========================================
v0.1.2  (Build 154, released May 1, 2007) 
===========================================
Emulation only release

Enhancements:
-------------
* Massive improvements to the MPI interfaces, including:
   * Consistent error status scheme (accessors return values, not error codes,
     e.g., tErrType GetVersion(tVersion) -> tVersion GetVersion())
   * Consistent ordering of input/output parameters in function parameter lists
   * Consistent iteration scheme (FindFirstX()/FindNextX())
   * Const correct interfaces
   * Pass by reference whenever a parameter is not optional (e.g., 
     FindRsrc(CURI*) -> FindRsrc(const CURI&))
   * Framework for using C++ namespaces as documented in Brio spec is in place
   * Consistent variable naming scheme
   * Errors and event definitions are now decentralized
   * Consistently use zero values as invalid state
   * Reduction of repetitive parameters (e.g., DebugMPI ctor now takes 
     the signature parameter, which has been removed as the first
     parameter from all of the DebugOutXXX() functions)
   * Removed the repetitive GetMPIVersion() functions
   * Changed the tVersion type from major/minor scheme to a straight U16 value
   * Function names of form VerbNoun() (e.g., InitMutex() rather than MutexInit())
   * Simplified timer function interfaces to work with milliseconds only 
     rather than milliseconds and microseconds
* Display Manager initial implementation (mainly stubbed out)
* Font Manager initial implementation
* Resource Manager "M" functions (seek & write resource functions)
* Updated sample programs to use the improved MPI interfaces
* Updated the Simple sample to demonstrate use of the Font Manager interface
* Extended internal error reporting through the Debug module

Bug Fixes:
----------
* Default emulation window size is now 320x240 rather than 240x320

Known Issues:
-------------
* Repeated emulation button events are generated when a button is held down


===========================================
v0.1.1  (Build 1, released April 6, 2007)
===========================================
Initial release
Emulation only release

Implementations of the following Modules:
-----------------------------------------
* Kernel ("H" functions including Task creation, message queue, 
  memory allocation)
* Debug
* Audio (low level driver in place, StartAudio/StopAudio calls with 
  audio done events)
* Event Manager (all events handled at high priority)
* Button Manager
* Resource Manager ("H" functions for opening and loading resources)
