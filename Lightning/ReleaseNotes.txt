Lightning C++ Development Kit Release Notes
===========================================

===========================================
v0.1.3  (Build XXX, released May XXX, 2007) 
===========================================

Release only for target hardware, not emulation.

First release that runs on target hardware (MP2530F).  Note that this release
is meant to work with the following software components on the target
hardware:

* Linux Kernel Image: zImage-2.6.20.1-dev-00
* u-boot image: u-boot-svn183.bin
* root file system: nfsroot-svnXXX.tar.gz

Enhancements:
-------------


Known Issues:
-------------

===========================================
v0.1.2  (Build 154, released May 1, 2007) 
===========================================
Emulation only release

Enhancements:
-------------
* Massive improvements to the MPI interfaces, including:
   * Consistent error status scheme (accessors return values, not error codes,
     e.g., tErrType GetVersion(tVersion) -> tVersion GetVersion())
   * Consistent ordering of input/output parameters in function parameter lists
   * Consistent iteration scheme (FindFirstX()/FindNextX())
   * Const correct interfaces
   * Pass by reference whenever a parameter is not optional (e.g., 
     FindRsrc(CURI*) -> FindRsrc(const CURI&))
   * Framework for using C++ namespaces as documented in Brio spec is in place
   * Consistent variable naming scheme
   * Errors and event definitions are now decentralized
   * Consistently use zero values as invalid state
   * Reduction of repetitive parameters (e.g., DebugMPI ctor now takes 
     the signature parameter, which has been removed as the first
     parameter from all of the DebugOutXXX() functions)
   * Removed the repetitive GetMPIVersion() functions
   * Changed the tVersion type from major/minor scheme to a straight U16 value
   * Function names of form VerbNoun() (e.g., InitMutex() rather than MutexInit())
   * Simplified timer function interfaces to work with milliseconds only 
     rather than milliseconds and microseconds
* Display Manager initial implementation (mainly stubbed out)
* Font Manager initial implementation
* Resource Manager "M" functions (seek & write resource functions)
* Updated sample programs to use the improved MPI interfaces
* Updated the Simple sample to demonstrate use of the Font Manager interface
* Extended internal error reporting through the Debug module

Bug Fixes:
----------
* Default emulation window size is now 320x240 rather than 240x320

Known Issues:
-------------
* Repeated emulation button events are generated when a button is held down


===========================================
v0.1.1  (Build 1, released April 6, 2007)
===========================================
Initial release
Emulation only release

Implementations of the following Modules:
-----------------------------------------
* Kernel ("H" functions including Task creation, message queue, 
  memory allocation)
* Debug
* Audio (low level driver in place, StartAudio/StopAudio calls with 
  audio done events)
* Event Manager (all events handled at high priority)
* Button Manager
* Resource Manager ("H" functions for opening and loading resources)
