====================================================
Release Proceedure for Lightning C++ Development Kit
====================================================

Note: Much of this will be automatable when we update to the newest Ubuntu
distribution, which should include a SVN 1.4 client.


============
Building
============
1) Open Eclipse
2) Right click on the Brio2 root node and select the "Team | Synchronize with Repository" menu item
3) In the Eclipse Syncronize Perspective, update to the latest source
4) Right click on the Brio2 root and select "Properties".  Click on the "C/C++ Make Properties" tab
5) Make sure the make command line is "scons -k emulation=t publish=t
6) Clean the Brio2 project
7) Build the Brio2 project
8) Build it again to build and run the unit tests
9) Verify that all unit tests pass and work with team to fix any failures
10) The end result if a fully populated "Brio2/Publish" folder
11) Verify the build by creating a new C/C++ Standard Make project
    a) Change its C/C++ Make Properties to "scons -k emulation=t"
    b) Copy the contents of the /Brio2/Lightning/Samples/BrioCube folder into your new project folder
    c) Build the new project
    d) Run the new project.  Try pressing the arrow keys, the keypad + and -, Ins and Del keys and
       verify that audio, resource loading, and button events are working
12) Repeat step 11 using the contents of the /Brio2/Lightning/Samples/Simple project


===============
Smoke testing
===============
For step 3 of "Distributing" below, team members will extract the RC files from the zip and
repeat steps 11 & 12 above, changing line 34 of the SConstruct files from:
   '/home/lfu/workspace/Brio2/Publish'
to
   '/home/LightningSDK_<build#>'

===============
Distributing
===============
TBD
For now, do this:
1) Rename the "Publish" folder to be "LightningSDK_<build#>, where build # is the current
   SVN repository #.
2) Zip up the renamed folder
3) Email it to the other team members for a quick smoke test
4) After smoke testing, email it to the following people: 
	Lovica Callisti; Chris Fernandes; Dennis O'Brien; Celso Aguiar; Emil Gilliam
