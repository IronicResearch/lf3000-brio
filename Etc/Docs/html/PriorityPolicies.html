<div class="textblock"><p>Channels and players are limited resources. When all channels are full, or the maximum number of players are active, calls to StartAudio will fail unless suitable resources can be freed. Some programmers may wish to set priorities such that some audio can be halted to free resources for a new audio. The policy of when a player can be stopped to make room for a new player is called the priority policy. The priority policy can be changed on the fly by calling SetPriorityPolicy. The policies are described below:</p>
<p>kAudioPriorityPolicyNone: This is the default priority policy that is used if no call is made to SetPriorityPolicy. It means that priority is totally ignored. Under this policy, if a user calls StartAudio and all channels are full or the maximum number of players are in use, StartAudio will fail.</p>
<p>kAudioPriorityPolicySimple: This priority policy operates in the following way:</p>
<p>Case 0: The system has a free channel and the max number of players of the desired type has not been exceeded. In this case, a call to StartAudio succeeds and no players are halted.</p>
<p>Case 1: The system has a free channel, but the maximum number of players are active. In this case, the players will be ordered in a list by priority. The system will search the list from lowest to highest priority. The first player that it encounters whose priority is LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO the new player's be halted and the call to StartAudio will succeed. If no player has such a priority, StartAudio will fail.</p>
<p>Case 2: The system does not have a free channel, and the maximum number of players of the desired type has not been exceeded. In this case, the players connected to the channels will be ordered in a list by priority. The system will search the list from lowest to highest priority. The first player that it encounters whose priority is LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO the new player's will be halted and the call to StartAudio will succeed. If no player has such a priority, StartAudio will fail.</p>
<p>Case 3: The system does not have a free channel, and the maximum number of players of the desired type are active. In this case, the priority will be evaluated FIRST for the player as described in Case 1, then for the channel as described in Case 2. </p>
