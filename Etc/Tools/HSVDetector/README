hsvDetect

hsvDetect is a simple application used to determine the HSV values of the controller LEDs
used in vision processing.  There are three pairs of inputs for this application, two sliders
to adjust the Hue lower and uppoer bound, two sliders for the Saturation lower and upper bound
and two sliders for the Value lower and upper bound.  There are two output display, "Video"
which shows the live feed from the camera and "Light" which shows the binary image created
by taking the live camera feed converting it to the HSV color space, performing an inRage 
calculation where only the pixels that are within the HSV bounds prescribed from the input
sliders remain and then finally creating a binary image of the pixels that ARE in the HSV
range and the pixels that ARE NOT in the range.  

This allows real-time adjustment of the HSV bounds to determine the ideal settings for 
tracking the specific color being emmitted from the controller.

This application must be used in concert with another application that enables turning
the controller LED on and changing it between the various colors availble.

Instructions for building and running:
NOTE: Do not source the angstrom environment script before running
