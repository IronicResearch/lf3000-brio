CameraExposureREADME

In order to use the wand (light tracking) in emulation you must install and
use v4l2ucp, a control panel for video4linux cameras.  

INSTALLATION
From your Ubuntu command line, type:
$ sudo apt-get install v4l2ucp

This should download, unpack and install the appropriate libraries and 
executables to use v4l2ucp.

RUNNING
Launch the app:
$ v4l2ucp

The app defaults to the camera on /dev/video0, you can open other cameras via
File->Open, however, the VNVisionMPI library is expecting to use the camera
located at /dev/video0 in emulation.

ADJUST SETTINGS
Follow these steps once the app is open and every time after you launch your
wand tracking app:
* change "Exposure, Auto" to "Manual Mode"
* press the "Update" button next to the Exposure, Auto drop down menu
* press the "Update button next the "Exposure (Absolute)" setting
* adjust the "Exposure (Absolute)" slider by moving it up and then down to
  the lowest possible value.  This is setting the exposure time to the shortest
  duration possible

You can leave the v4l2ucp app open during multiple runnings of your wand 
tracking app, however each time you restart your wand tracking app you will
need to follow the steps under ADJUST SETTINGS.
