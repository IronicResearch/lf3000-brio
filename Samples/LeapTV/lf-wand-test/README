lf-wand-test

Revision: 1.7
Original Date: 1/16/2014
Update 1.1 1/24/2014
  * Stop rendering the camera feed and use a solid color background
  * Render the cursor
  * Adjust one rectangular hot spot to be partially offscreen to test the
    clipping functionality of VNRectHotSpot objects when used in the 
    VNWandTracker algorithm
  * Add an arbitrary shape hot spot via loading an image file into a 
    CBlitBuffer object.  The image is a plus sign.  This hot spot is
    also partially off the screen to test the clipping functionality
    of VNArbitraryShapeHotSpot objects with an tFontSurf as input and
    when used in the VNWandTracker algorithm.
Update 1.2 2/15/2014
  * Adjust rendering to fit full screen
  * Render hot spots scaled based on vision and screen sizes
Update 1.3 3/19/2014
  * Add wand scaling to wand tracking algorithm
  * Add optional input parameters and pass in to wnad tracker constructor
  * User should notice as they get further from the camera the distance 
    side-to-side and up-and-down they must move the wand to traverse the
    entire screen is smaller.
Update 1.4 4/2/2014
  * Updated UI to fill screen on both device and in emulation
  * Added a scale factor to the capture size allowing for easier transition
    between qVGA and VGA modes in the app
  * Moves scaling of hot spot locations back in to the application code
    while continued progress is made to keep the scaling internal to VisionMPI
Update 1.5 4/13/2014
  * Added the ability to cycle through the LED lights
  * Use controller A button to cycle through LED colors
  * Use controller B button to turn off the LED
Update 1.6 5.13.2014
  * Change the vision back to running on it's own thread to verify
    memory issue when shutting down the state.
Update 1.7 6/4/2014
  * Add support to switch wand LED tracking between multiple connected controllers
  * Use the '?' (hint) button to start tracking a controller
  * Change back non threaded vision update as that mode of running is deprecated now
Update 1.8 6/5/2014 (PP)
  * Some Modifications to logic.
  * Use A button to steal control (turn off other controllers light and turn on self)
  * B button will cycle light only on controller with control
  * HOME button to quit
  * removed HINT button switch, since it was confusing
  
The lf-wand-test will show a video preview on the screen.  Towards the top
of the preview there should be two outlines of rectangular boxes.  The color
of the outline should stay constant, even if you move in front of them. If
you have one of the prototype wands with the green light and move the wand
such that the green light is over one of the boxes (the center of the light 
mustbe inside of the box) the color of the outline should change.  Once 
you remove the light from within the box the outline should go back to the
original color.

This tests the VNWandTracker algorithm and VNPointTrigger classes.
