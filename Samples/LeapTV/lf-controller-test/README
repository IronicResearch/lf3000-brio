The lf-controller-test app demonstrates acquiring accelerometer, button and
analog stick events/data from a controller class that is conencted to a 
physical controller device (currently the Wiimote).  All controller data
is acquired via controller events being sent to the main state of this
application.  The controller class is passed in the controller message and
data is then read out from the controller class.  Current output of
the data is in the following format:
* analog stick data moves rendered prism
* accelerometer data is printed out to the console
* button data is printed out to the console

NOTES:
* The Wii Nunchuck is used as the controller input
* lf-input-daemon needs to be run and paired with a Wiimote + Nunchuck
  before starting the app
