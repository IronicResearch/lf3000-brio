lf-vision-test

Revision: 1.4
Original Date: 1/16/2014
Update 1.1 1/24/2014
  * Moved the circular hot spot to be partially offscreen to test clipping
    of VNCircleHotSpot objects
  * Moved one of the rectangular hot spots to be partially offscree to test
    clipping of VNRectHotSpot objects
  * Added a VNArbitraryHotSpot that is programmatically created and is 
    partially offscreen to test the clipping of VNArbitraryShapeHotSpot
    objects.  This also tests arbitrary shape hot spots with the occlusion
    trigger
Update 1.2 2/15/2014
  * Fix vision image size
  * Render camera image scaled to size of display
  * Render hot spots scaled from vision size to display size
Update 1.3 4/2/2014
  * Updated UI to fill screen on both device and in emulation
  * Added a scale factor to the capture size allowing for easier transition
    between qVGA and VGA modes in the app
  * Moves scaling of hot spot locations back in to the application code
    while continued progress is made to keep the scaling internal to VisionMPI
Update 1.4 5/29/2014
  * Do not call VNVisionMPI::Update as that is being driven by the camera now

The lf-wand-test will show a video preview on the screen.  Towards the top
of the preview there should be two outlines of rectangular boxes.  The color
of the outline should stay constant, even if you move in front of them. If
you have one of the prototype wands with the green light and move the wand
such that the green light is over one of the boxes (the center of the light 
mustbe inside of the box) the color of the outline should change.  Once 
you remove the light from within the box the outline should go back to the
original color.

This tests the VNWandTracker algorithm and VNPointTrigger classes.
