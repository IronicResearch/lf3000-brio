This test is meant to test the virtual touch algorithm with a variety of
hot spot types and trigger types.  It also does the camera frame redenring
via the DisplayMPI viewfinder as opposed to using OpenGL.  In additon this
application can be configured to turn off OpenGL rendering by changing the
DRAW_HOTSPOTS defnition to:
#define DRAW_HOTSPOTS 0
