HotSpotTriggerinTest

Revision: 1.1
Original Date: 5/29/2014

The HotSpotTriggeringTest has teh ability to test three different virtual touch 
hot spot scenarios, a single hot spot, one quarter of the screen covered with
hot spots and the full screen covered with hot spots, in addition to having the
ability to turn OpenGL and camera viewframe rendering on and off independently.
This test is to insure the virtual touch algorithm, with a full screen of hot
spots runs at interactive speeds.

To turn OpenGL rendering off change line 1 of VTCHMainState.cpp to
#define RENDER_WITH_OGL 0

To turn viewfinder rendering off change line 2 of VTCHMainState.cpp to
#define RENDER_WITH_DISPLAY_MPI 0

To change the number of hot spots edit VTCHMainState.cpp such that the
HOT_SPOT_FLAG is set to your desired level of hot spot coverage.
