<h2>Compiling for Embedded Systems - Part II </h2>
<h3>Playing MIDI Files</h3>
To play a Standard MIDI File (SMF) you need to get it into memory as an
unsigned char array. There are 3 ways to do that.
<ol>
<li>
Convert the MIDI file to 'C' source code for an unsigned char array and
compile it with your program. This will work on systems that do not support
file I/O or database access. An example song has been provided in the file
"spmidi/examples/UpAndDown.c". We can provide a shell tool called "bintoc"
that will convert SMF files to 'C'. Also the Mobileer Instrument Editor (licensed separately) can export songs and playlists as 'C' source. </li>

<li>
If you have support for file I/O on your system and want to load MIDI
files into memory then use the function SPMUtil_LoadFileImage() from "spmidi/util/spmidi_load.c".</li>

<li>
Load a SMF from your ringtone database.</li>
</ol>
The file "minimal_player.c" contains an example program that uses the MIDI
file contained in "spmidi/examples/UpAndDown.c". I recommend using that
for testing your first player program.
<p>At this point you should be able to play any MIDI file that is stored
as a (char *) array in memory.
<h3>
Ringtone Database and System Integration</h3>
The final step is to integrate the SP-MIDI Ringtone Player with your system.
You may need support for:
<ul>
<li>
downloading ringtones as SMF files,</li>

<li>
storing ringtones in a database in Flash ROM,</li>

<li>
previewing and selecting ringtones,</li>

<li>
triggering the selected ringtone when the phone rings.</li>
</ul>
Those functions are very specific to your system and are not part of the
basic Mobileer product. But we could develop such software to your specification
if desired.
