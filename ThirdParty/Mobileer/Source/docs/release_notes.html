<h2>Release Notes</h2>
<p>(The Release Notes for the Mobileer Instrument Editor after V1.94 may be found <a href="editor/releases.html">here</a>.)</p>
<h3>Release 2.00 4/?/07</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added support for lowPitch, highPitch, lowVelocity and highVelocity to WaveSetRegion. Requires new format of orchestra exported from Mobileer Editor.  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Release 1.94 5/22/06</h3>
<p>Synthesizer</p>
<ul>
    <li>Added an example Unix Makefile in &quot;spmidi/build&quot;.</li>
    <li>Added a &quot;tools/convert_mid_smid.c&quot; that pre-processes and converts a MIDI file to a very simple SMID format. This reduces the run-time overhead and may be useful for low performance or memory limited platforms. See also &quot;include/midistream_player.h&quot;.</li>
    <li>Added support for ALaw compressed wavetables. This has a 2:1 compression ratio.</li>
    <li>Add support for using velocity ranges with ME2000 instruments.</li>
    <li>Use concave response curve for MIDI Controller 7 messages.</li>
    <li>Provide option to use concave response to MIDI velocity by setting defining SPMIDI_SQUARE_VELOCITY as (1). The default linear response is generally preferred because it offers a natural compression.</li>
    <li>Fixed bug related to initial settings of the Fine and Coarse Tuning controller. The tuning could be off if the composer only set the Fine control and did not also set the Coarse controller.</li>
    <li>In DLS files instruments, bit 31, the &quot;Drum Bit&quot;, is now ignored properly when matching instruments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Editor</p>
<ul>

<p>Synthesizer</p>
<ul>
    <li>Reduce bytes per voice by 60 bytes. </li>

    <li>General size reduction of many structures.</li>
    <li>Articulations for DLS now allocated in an array instead of linked list nodes.    </li>
    <li>Corrected pitch calculation for DLS instrument wavetables that had a fineTuning offset.</li>
    <li>Disabled ramping down of stolen voices because ramp was noticeable in some instruments. </li>
</ul>

    <li>Changed XMFParser_Error_WrongVersion to XMFParser_Error_WrongType because it relates to whether the file is of type &quot;Mobile XMF&quot;. </li>
    <li> Added configuration variable SPMIDI_MAX_NUM_PLAYERS. Can be set to (1) for simple applications that only need to play one song at a time. This will save memory. The default is (SPMIDI_MAX_NUM_CONTEXTS * 2) </li>
    <li>Added &quot;examples/play_no_io.c&quot; which is mostly useful for measuring RAM usage on target systems.</li>
    <li>Added &quot;<a href="qa/badxmf.html">qa/Bad_*.mxmf</a>&quot; files for testing corrupt file handling. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Release 1.90 - 6/6/05</h3>
<p>Synthesizer</p>
