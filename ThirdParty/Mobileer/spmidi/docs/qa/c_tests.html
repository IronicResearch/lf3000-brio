<h2>'C' Tests</h2>
<p>The source code for these tests can be found in the directory &quot;<strong>spmidi/qa</strong>&quot;.</p>
<p><a href="../autodocs/html/files.html">Documentation on individual tests can be found by looking for files that start with &quot;qa_&quot; in the file list. </a></p>
<p>The tests can be generally divided into two groups:

<ul>
    <li>'C' tests of the core engine: voice allocation and stealing, pitch resolution, and so on.</li>
    <li>Memory-related 'C' tests: exercising the memory allocation facilities. These are critical to ensure that the host device running the Mobileer ME3000 engine is not destabilized by memory leaks or invalid references.</li>
</ul>
<p>These test types are not mutually exclusive: for example, most file-related
    tests include extensive memory checks.
<p>When run, the tests return 0 if successful, or non-0 otherwise. Most tests print a summary line on completion indicating successes and failures. Many tests print specific information at failure points if they fail. 
<p>Core engine tests use techniques such as pitch measurement using zero-crossing
      detection and amplitude measurement using envelope following to analyze audio
      output and compare it against expectations. The SDK has extensive measurement
      and status-reporting routines that are also used to make sure that expected
    results actually occur.</p>
<p>The memory-related portions of the SDK include monitoring and status routines,
  as well as stress-testing functions that enable tests to specifically cause
  memory allocations to fail in predictable ways. This allows us to check that
  other parts of the engine that utilize the memory APIs handle allocation failures
  properly. </p>
<p>All qa tests define a main() function. Building a test results in an executable,
  which can be run from the console. The exit value of the executable indicates
  success or failure of the test as a whole: 0 means all the tests in the executable
  succeeded, and non-0 means one or more tests failed. The qa test suite can
  be run as a whole by building each test and running an appropriate shell script
  or batch file that
  executes each built test in sequence, checks the return value and takes appropriate
  action (for example, logging output).</p>
