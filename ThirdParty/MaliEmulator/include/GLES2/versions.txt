Header file versions
====================

# gl2.h, gl2ext.h, and gl2platform.h were downloaded from silver connect on
Aug 24, 2009.
https://silver.arm.com/browse/ZX000
The versions in the current folder are from the folder Mali200 in the
downloaded bundle.

The above headers were used as the idea was to use the same set of headers
for all the tools on the Mali Developer Portal.
