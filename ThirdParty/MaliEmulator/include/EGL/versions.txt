Header file versions
====================

# egl.h and eglext.h were downloaded from silver connect on Aug 24, 2009.
https://silver.arm.com/browse/ZX000
The versions in the current folder are from the folder Mali200 in the
downloaded bundle.

# eglplatform.h
This is a modified version of the Khronos eglplatform.h. The only change is
the addition of a macro (EGLint). This will be shipped in the emulator bundle.

The above headers were used as the idea was to use the same set of headers
for all the tools on the Mali Developer Portal.
